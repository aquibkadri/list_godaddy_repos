# Github Repo List

Library used: React

This is built over Vite which is recently popular build tool over Webpack.

Notes:

React Router is also used here.

A fork can be other set of repos itself. Thus, that component redering for that is handled using recursion.

Things that can be added:

Caching
Avoiding unnecessary API calls.
Blocking unrequired API calls.
React Query can be used to handle data more efficiently.
Code Splitting
Loaders can be added
Tests can be added
Better styling
etc.
